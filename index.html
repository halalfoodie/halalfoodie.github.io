      <h1>FAQ: HALAL Diet</h1>
      <p>
        What is <b>HALAL</b> Food? </br>
        <strong>Answer:</strong> Foods that are permitted under Islamic dietary laws.
        Vegetables, Dairy, Eggs, Fish, and Seafoods are HALAL as long as they are not contaminated with HARAM Foods! </br></br>
        Well, what is <b>HARAM</b> Food? </br>
        <strong>Answer:</strong> Pork and Alcohol are HARAM (aka forbidden)! </br></br>
        Fair enough, what about meats other than pork? </br>
        <strong>Answer:</strong> Some meats are HALAL with <i>conditions</i>! The potential HALAL meat sources include 
        Herbivore and Omnivore Birds (Chicken, Ducks, Turkey, Pigeons, Doves, etc.), and all even-toed ungulate 
        animals that chew the cud like Camels, Cattle (Cows, Buffaloes, etc.), and Antelopes (Deers, Sheep, Goats, etc.).
        </br>
        Conversely, some meats are always HARAM. These sources are Equine animals (Donkeys, Mules), Fanged animals (Cats, Dogs, Bears, etc.), 
        Birds of prey (Eagles, Owls, Parrots, etc.), Reptiles (Snakes, Lizards, etc.), and some other animals such as monkeys.
        </br></br>
        What are the <b>conditions</b> again? </br>
        <strong>Answer:</strong> The animal or bird needs to be slaughtered following the Islamic guidelines. </br></br>
        Is there any way to understand if the guidelines were followed? </br>
        <strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, there are institutions that certify HALAL slaughtering, and usually, it contains a HALAL sign on the package. </br></br>
    
        Is it not too much to remember? </br>
        <strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, at first, it might be difficult to remember. 
        But you can always come back to this page for reference or search on the internet. </br>
