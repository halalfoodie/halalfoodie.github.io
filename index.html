      <h1>Sequential Questions: HALAL Diet</h1>
      <p>
        What is <b>HALAL</b> Food? </br>
        <strong>Answer:</strong> Foods that are permitted under Islamic dietary laws.
        Vegetables, Dairy, Eggs, Fish and Seafoods are HALAL as long as they are not contaminated with HARAM Foods! </br></br>
        Well, what is <b>HARAM</b> Food? </br> 
        <strong>Answer:</strong> Alcohol, some meats & animal derivatives (gelatin, emulsifier, shortening, etc) are HARAM (aka forbidden). </br></br>
        Fair enough, what is the deal with <b> meats & animal derivatives</b>? </br>
        <strong>Answer:</strong> Meats & animal derivatives are HALAL only if they pass through a <i>2-Step Verification</i>. 
        </br>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>First Step:</strong> This step is the classification of animals. For example, commonly eaten terrestrial animals
            such as cows, lambs, and chickens are permissible, but pigs are forbidden.
            <div id="expandableContent">
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Permissible</strong></li> The potential HALAL meat sources include 
                Herbivore and Omnivore Birds (Chicken, Ducks, Turkey, Pigeons, Doves, etc.), and all even-toed ungulate 
                animals that chew the cud e.g. Camels, Cattles (Cows, Buffaloes, etc.), and Antelopes (Deers, Sheep, Goats, etc.).
                <li><strong>Forbidden</strong></li> Conversely, Forever HARAM sources are Equine animals (Donkeys, Mules), Fanged animals (Cats, Dogs, Bears, etc.), 
                Birds of prey (Eagles, Owls, Parrots, etc.), Reptiles (Snakes, Lizards, etc.), and some other animals such as Monkeys.
              </ul>
            </div>
            <button id="expandButton">Read More >></button></br>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Second Step:</strong> This step is the performance of a ritual. To qualify as HALAL, the permissible mammals or birds need to be slaughtered following Islamic guidelines. 
          </li>
        </ol>

        Is there any way to confirm if the <b>Islamic guidelines</b> were followed? </br>
        <strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, there are institutions that certify HALAL slaughter, often indicated by a HALAL sign on the packaging.
        </br></br>
        Is it not too much to remember? </br>
        <strong>Answer:</strong> Initially, it might be challenging to remember all the details. However, you can always revisit this page for reference or search the internet for more information. </br>
